# Introduction to Bella

Bella is programming language built on top of .NET Framework. Bella code is transpiled by source-to-source compiler into C#. Generated code is WCF application.

## Why Bella?

Bella facilitates rapid development of solutions based on [SOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture) architecture.

* You could define business logic in a simple and lightweight manner. So, language simplicity reduces number of potential errors.
* You don't need to worry about transactional scopes and how you persist the data.
* It is easy to write cross-component code. Contracts are shared in mono repository and you don't need to care about contract versioning and regeneration.
